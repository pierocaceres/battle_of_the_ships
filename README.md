## Description  
  
This project recreates the classic game of Battleship. Javascript will power the logic of the game while using HTML/CSS for the visual elements. The *User* (Player 1) will be playing against the *Computer* (Player 2) on a 5x5 grid. Each player will be given 5 ships to place on the battlefield. The first player to sink their opponents battleship wins.

Note: Battleships will have a size of 1x1. If we get a working prototype functioning, different ship sizes will be implemented.
